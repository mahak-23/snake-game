## Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls of the game board. This project is a simple implementation of the Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features

- Control the snake's movement using arrow keys or on-screen buttons (for mobile devices).
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game board's boundaries.
- Keeps track of the player's score and highest score achieved.

### Technologies Used

- HTML: Structuring the webpage and game board.
- CSS: Styling the game elements for better visual representation.
- JavaScript: Implementing game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and scoring.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement (Up, Down, Left, Right).
2. Alternatively, if playing on a mobile device, use the on-screen buttons for directional control.
3. The snake will automatically start moving in the default direction.
4. Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the game board.
5. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases.
6. Avoid collisions with the walls of the game board and the snake's own body.
7. The game ends when the snake collides, and a game-over message is displayed.
8. If you achieve a new high score, it will be saved locally and displayed on subsequent plays.
